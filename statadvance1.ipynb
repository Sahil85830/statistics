    "A **point estimate** is a single value used to approximate an unknown population parameter. It provides a best guess but does not indicate uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. Other common point estimates include the sample proportion for the population proportion and the sample standard deviation for the population standard deviation.  \n",

    "#### **Interval Estimates**  \n",
    "An **interval estimate** provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence.  \n",

    "For example, a ninety five percent confidence interval for a population mean might be fifty to sixty, meaning the true mean is likely within this range.  \n",

    "A point estimate provides a single value, while an interval estimate gives a range of values. A point estimate is less accurate because it does not account for variability, whereas an interval estimate is more reliable since it considers uncertainty.  \n",
